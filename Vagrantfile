  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     # Don't boot with headless mode
     vb.gui = true
  
     # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
     vb.name = 'play_vm'
  end
	
  config.vm.provision :shell, :inline => "mkdir -p /etc/puppet/modules && ( (puppet module list | grep puppetlabs-stdlib) || puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib)"
	
  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests
  # are contained in a directory path relative to this Vagrantfile.
  # You will need to create the manifests directory and a manifest in
  # the file default.pp in the manifests_path directory.
  #
  config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
    puppet.manifests_path = "manifests"
    puppet.manifest_file  = "site.pp"
